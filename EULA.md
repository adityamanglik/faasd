## OpenFaaS Community Edition (CE) EULA Addendum

faasd is part of OpenFaaS Community Edition (CE) and is subject to the [OpenFaaS CE EULA](https://github.com/openfaas/faas/blob/master/EULA.md). Additional clauses apply to faasd only, to enable certain commercial usage for Individuals and within Small Business Environments.

A license can be purchased by separate agreement from OpenFaaS Ltd for OpenFaaS Edge (the commercial release of faasd), which is subject to the standard [OpenFaaS Pro EULA](https://github.com/openfaas/faas/blob/master/pro/EULA.md).

End User License Agreement (EULA) Addendum for faasd Licensed Software.

This addendum to the OpenFaaS Community Edition EULA applies specifically to the use of faasd. It governs the conditions under which faasd may be used within Small Business Environments and for Personal Use.

1. Definitions

1.1 Small Business Environment:

A "Small Business Environment" is defined as any commercial entity with fewer than 10 employees including full/part-time staff and contractors. And either less than US $1,000,000 (or equivalent local currency) in annual revenue or less than US $1,000,000 in total funding raised. Internal usage refers to faasd being used solely within the business for developing, testing, or deploying solutions for internal purposes or hosted services offered by the business, without distributing faasd itself to end clients or customers. If you exceed (or reasonably anticipate exceeding) these thresholds within the next 12 months, a separate commercial license must be obtained.

1.2 Agreement Parties. This Agreement is between You ("Licensor") and OpenFaaS Ltd. ("Supplier").

1.3 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of England and Wales.

1.4 Personal Use:

"Personal Use" refers to the use of faasd by individuals for personal or commercial purposes, including hosting or running applications. This includes using faasd as part of a hosted solution (e.g., hosting functions or running a commercial application) but does not permit distributing faasd itself to clients or customers.

2. License Grant for faasd

2.1 Small Business Environment Use:

faasd may be used for limited commercial purposes within a Small Business Environment. This includes deploying faasd as part of a hosted solution or for internal usage (e.g., running functions or commercial applications for internal or customer-facing services), provided that faasd itself is not distributed, resold, or sublicensed to end clients or customers. The license covers internal use or as part of a hosted solution but restricts distributing faasd binaries. faasd binaries may be distributed to servers controlled (infrastructure rented, leased, or owned) by the Licensor to host applications for end customers, as long as the faasd software itself is not transferred, leased, or otherwise provided to those customers.

2.2 Personal Use:

faasd may be used by individuals for personal projects or commercial purposes, including hosting solutions for their own commercial applications or functions. This includes using faasd as part of a hosted solution (e.g., running functions or a commercial application within faasd), provided that faasd itself is not distributed to end clients or customers as part of the solution.

An individual acting on behalf of a business or as a sole proprietor would not qualify under Personal Use if that business surpasses the Small Business Environment thresholds.

Use under Personal Use is subject to the same restrictions in Section 3.

3. Restrictions on faasd Use

3.1 No Resale or Redistribution:

faasd may not be resold, distributed, or provided as part of a product or service directly to end clients or customers, regardless of whether those entities meet the Small Business Environment criteria outlined above. This includes embedding faasd into a software or service that is distributed to other businesses or individuals.

3.2 Non-transferability:

The rights to use faasd under this addendum are non-transferable. If the user or business does not meet the definition of a Small Business Environment or if Personal Use criteria do not apply, a separate commercial license must be obtained from OpenFaaS Ltd. If the entity meets the Small Business Environment or Personal Use criteria, no additional license is required.

4. Compliance

4.1 License Enforcement:

OpenFaaS Ltd reserves the right to implement reasonable measures to verify compliance with this faasd EULA addendum. The Customer agrees to cooperate with any compliance verification efforts conducted by OpenFaaS Ltd.

5. Termination of faasd License

This addendum and the license granted hereunder are effective upon installation and use of faasd. OpenFaaS Ltd reserves the right to terminate this license if any of the terms outlined in this addendum are violated. Upon termination, Licensor must remove or destroy all copies of faasd in their possession or control (including any backups).

6. Limitation of Liability

6.1 Warranty Disclaimer:

“FAASD IS PROVIDED ‘AS IS’ WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. IN NO EVENT SHALL LICENSOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES, OR OTHER LIABILITY ARISING FROM OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR ITS USE.”

6.2 Liability Limitations:

OpenFaaS Ltd shall not be liable for any indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages arising out of the use or inability to use faasd.
